Hi future students and/or SCE officers!

So the sign isn't working. Bummer. Let's check a few things first:

1. If Raspbian loads but the keyboard doesn't work and the mouse does, the installation
   may have gotten corrupted. Download the latest Raspbian OS and install to a NEW MicroSD
   card. On Windows you can use a program called "BalenaEtcher" to write a Raspbian image
   to an SD card directly from the Raspbian distribution ZIP file you downloaded.

Configuration after installing Raspbian:

1. Blacklist the bcm_2835 sound module:

   cat <<EOF | sudo tee /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-rgb-matrix.conf
   blacklist snd_bcm2835
   EOF
   sudo update-initramfs -u

Initial setup

2. Try the LED panel control library demo program first. Look at this directory:

   ~/sce-led-sign/src/third-party/rpi-rgb-led-matrix  
   
   This is a git repository for the LED panel control library we use.
   Be sure to updated it to the latest version and try running the demo program to verify 
   things are working:

   cd examples-api-use
   sudo ./demo -D0 --led-gpio-mapping=adafruit-hat --led-cols=128

   This should show a spinning cube in the middle of the display.
   
3. Try the sign application

   sudo ./sce-sign --set-font-filename fonts/9x18.bdf --set-text "Test message"

   Hopefully it will work!
